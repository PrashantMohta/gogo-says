# gogo-says
An Introduction project to Go Programming language, based around the quotes and shenanigans of a certain crime master ;)

It is mostly a way for me to introduce myself to golang concepts like

* Types
* Branching
* Looping 
* Functions
* Go routines
* Channels
* waitGroups
* Mutex

as for the project itself, it is a small web application that listens to a route and tries to respond with a quote
from crime master gogo there is also a small twist on that in a second route where it randomises the words in multiple
quotes to create a synthetic quote that sounds like something crime master gogo would say (if he has no sense of grammar and sentence structure).
